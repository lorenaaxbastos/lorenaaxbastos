I have a degree in Visual Arts and extensive creative experience. I am currently studying Software Engineering and participating in Santander Coders 2023.2 | Data Science.

I am transitioning to the Data Science area, seeking to integrate creativity and technology to contribute in a meaningful way.

What sets me apart is my unique ability to transform data into impactful visual narratives, as well as my ability to approach problems more holistically in different contexts.
