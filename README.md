# About me

Hi ðŸ‘‹ Nice to meet you! I'm Lorena, a 30 year-old brazilian who loves both Math and Arts. 

## Professionally speaking...

ðŸŽ¨ I'm graduated in Visual Arts and I've got a lot of experience in creative areas, such as writing, graphic design, webdesign, 3d art and computational art.
ðŸ“ˆ I started a graduation in Software Engineering so I can pursue a career in Data Science. I hope to bring all my prior experience and soft skills such as communication, storytelling and creativity from Arts to Tech. Besides the graduation, I'm also a participant of the Santander Coders 2023.2 | Data Science program.

ðŸ“š I'm also a lifelong learning student who is always eager to learn something new everyday.
